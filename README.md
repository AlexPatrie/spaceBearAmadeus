- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex aka spaceBearAmadeus!

- 👀 I am a classical vocalist, guitarist, pianist, and teacher turned Dev who is humbly seeking to learn as much as possible.  I have recently realized that my
    skills as a classical musician are some of the same skills that I tap into as a programmer.  I have been harnessing the powers of my musicianship
    for good in the field of tech!  On top of being a music teacher, I am also the Technology Director for Stress Free Solutions Home Improvement.

- 🌱  Data Structures, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning(Python).
      my goal is to make music accessible to everyone in the world!

- 💞️ As I just mentioned, I’m looking to collaborate on ANYTHING.  Literally, anything.  I am at the point where I would like as much constructive feedback
     as possible from those that are more experienced than I.  Also, music!
